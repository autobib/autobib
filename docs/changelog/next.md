# Unreleased

Changes since `v0.6.1`.

## Breaking

- SQLite is now only bundled when the Cargo feature `bundled-sqlite` is enabled.
  This feature is enabled by default, but this may cause breakage with builds using `--no-default-features`.
  Disabling this feature will cause the compiled binary to link to your SQLite system library instead.
