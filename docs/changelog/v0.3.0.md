# Unreleased

Changes since `v0.2.0`.

# New features
- Added cache eviction functions under `autobib util evict`
- Merge duplicate records using `autobib merge`
- Added normalization methods to transform new records when they are added to the database
  - See the `[on_insert]` section of the example configuration for more detail
  - Normalizations are also accessible using `autobib edit` to modify existing records
- Associate files with records using `autobib path` and `autobib attach`
  - Search through attached files using `autobib find --attachments`
- Added sub-id normalization for simple transformations
- Added alias transformations, which allows defining custom regex rules to convert an alias in a special form to a `provider:sub-id` pair
  - See the `[alias_transform]` section of the example configuration
- Better output ergonomics for `autobib source` and `autobib get`:
  - `autobib source` has new `--skip*` flags which allow specifying keys to omit when retrieving from a file
  - `autobib source` and `autobib get` now support the `--append` flag (used with `--out`) which appends new entries, skipping any keys which are already present in the output file
- Added `preffered_providers` configuration option
- Interactive conflict resolution now has 'edit' option to edit the conflicting field value.
- New `autobib import` command to import records from `.bib` files
- Field key syntax is now more relaxed.

# Changes to providers
- Now support `isbn:` and `ol:` (OpenLibrary) providers
- Fixed spurious failure for some `arxiv:` records

# Fixes
- Fixed incorrect error code when calling with `-qq`
- Added interactivity checks throughout with better defaults
- Fixed some write errors when calling `autobib get` or `autobib out` with `--out` option
